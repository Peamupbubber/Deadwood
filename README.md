# Deadwood

by Hunter Smith, Shintaro Osuga, and Phelix Tang

To compile: run javac Deadwood.java in the command line. This will compile all classes as well.

To Play: run java Deadwood in the command line. This will prompt for player count. After that, enjoy the game!

Disclamer: the GUI version does not seem to work on linux platforms, or at least it does not work while SSHed into the lab machine
